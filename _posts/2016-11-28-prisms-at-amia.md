Principle investigators from PRISMS attended the <a href="https://www.amia.org/amia2016">AMIA 2016 Symposium</a> in Chicago to present the poster "Pediatric Research Using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS): Applying Sensor Technology and Informatics to Better Understand Asthma", which received a “Distinguished Poster” award (only given to 8 out of more than 350 posters at the conference).

<a href="https://www.amia.org">AMIA</a> is the professional home for leading informatics experts. The organization is influential on research, education, policy and clinical practice throughout the United States and internationally. The AMIA annual meeting is the primary meeting for the organization as a whole. The AMIA 2016 annual meeting was the 40th anniversary of the symposium
 
From the abstract:
<blockquote>The Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS) program was launched in 2015 to develop sensor-based, integrated health monitoring systems for measuring environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of pediatric asthma. PRISMS will develop an open platform and associated suite of tools to enable a comprehensive spectrum of biomedical research into chronic diseases in pediatric populations. We describe the PRISMS program goals, operations, and organization, and informatics challenges.</blockquote>
