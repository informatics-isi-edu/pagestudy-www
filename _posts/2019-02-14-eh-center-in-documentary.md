The Los Angeles PRISMS center, run by Dr. Rima Habre is featured in a new documentary about air pollution and asthma coming out soon called *[Something in the Air](http://somethingintheair.ca/)*. This film talks a lot about Habre's work around LAX ultrafines and also refers to the Los Angeles PRISMS center. 

> Recently Dr. Habre’s work reached the international stage through a documentary, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Company, called Something in the Air.  “The producers were very interested in learning more about our latest work around air pollution and asthma – specifically around the latest technologies we are using to better understand the impacts of small particles on a personal level – in children and adults with asthma, and in pregnant women.” Dr. Habre was interviewed about her work around ultrafine particle exposures downwind of major airports and its effects on asthma, as well as her work to understand how children’s personal exposure to air pollution predict their risk of experiencing an asthma attack. [Something in the Air](http://somethingintheair.ca/) will be released this week in Canada, with an international release to be announced.
