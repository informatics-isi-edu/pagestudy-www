Dr. Rima Habre participated as a Subject Matter Expert in the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) “Deliberating Performance Targets for Air Quality Sensors Workshop” held June 25-27, 2018 in Research Triangle Park,  NC ([https://www.epa.gov/air-research/presentations-deliberating-performance-targets-air-quality-sensors-workshop](https://www.epa.gov/air-research/presentations-deliberating-performance-targets-air-quality-sensors-workshop)). 

The workshop aimed at soliciting individual stakeholder views on non-regulatory performance targets for sensors that measure fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone and was attended by 700+ international delegates via the web and in person.  Dr. Habre discussed performance targets for wearable PM2.5 sensors integrated into real-time enabled informatics platforms, specifically for epidemiological research applications, based on the work being conducted in the [Los Angeles PRISMS Center (PI Alex Bui)](/projects/breathe/).
