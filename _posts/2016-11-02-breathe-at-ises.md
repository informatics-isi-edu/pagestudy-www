PRISMS investigators participated in the <a href="https://ises2016.org/">International Society for Exposure Science (ISES) 2016 IT/Sensor Fair</a> in Utrecht, Netherlands on October 12, 2016. The ISES Annual Conference brings together international scientists from more than 40 countries to exchange knowledge and expertise on Exposure Science, which is a critical component in assessing and protecting human, environmental and ecological health. The goal of the IT/Sensor Fair is to bring together exposure sensor developers and showcase state-of-the-art equipment, software and services that contribute to assessing environmental exposures and understanding their link to health.
