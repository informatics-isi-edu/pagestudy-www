PRISMS investigators organized a symposium session at the Joint Annual Meeting of the International Society of Exposure Science and the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISES-ISEE) held in Ottawa, Canada, in August 26-30, 2018 ([https://isesisee2018.org/](https://isesisee2018.org/)). 

The symposium was chaired by Dr. Rima Habre (U54) and included presentations from four individual PRISMS PI’s representing U01 centers and the U24 center: 

- [Steven Chillrud](/projects/monitoring-particulate-exposures/), PhD, Columbia University (U01)
- [Zhenyu Li](/projects/ambulatory-sensor-arrays/), PhD, George Washington University (U01)
- [Edmund Seto](/projects/temu/), PhD, University of Washington (U01), and 
- [Jose Luis Ambite](/projects/dscic/), PhD, University of Southern California (U24). 

The symposium also included a panel discussion around the value and potential for PRISMS sensor and informatics technologies at advancing environmental health research and understanding. Panelists included David Balshaw, PhD, Chief of the Exposure, Response, and Technology Branch, Division of Extramural Research and Training, NIEHS; Krystal Pollitt, PhD, PEng, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Public Health; and the PRISMS PI’s in attendance, including Kathy Sward, PhD, University of Utah (U54).

The Columbia University and University of Washington U01’s as well as the Utah and Los Angeles U54’s also participated in the ISES-ISEE 2018 Technology and Sensor Fair where the overall PRISMS and Data Modeling Working Group activities were displayed as well as the individual centers’ sensors and informatics platforms. Technology and Sensor Fair attendees expressed a lot of interest and enthusiasm around being able to obtain and use the devices and informatics platforms being developed within the PRISMS program for their own research projects.
