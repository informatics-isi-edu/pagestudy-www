  <p>The focus of the new research is on how genetic variants initially identified through GWAS research are related to a person's biological and physical characteristics, such as weight, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels or bone density. Scientists will also examine how non-genetic factors, such as diet, medications and smoking, may interact with genetic factors or each other to influence health outcomes.</p>

<p>The information generated by this program will help guide other genomic and epidemiologic studies by defining the potentially wide-ranging effects of genetic differences among people. Additionally, it will lay the groundwork for laboratory experiments in cultured cells and other model systems to identify the precise biological mechanism affected by each genetic variant and how it interacts with other biological and environmental factors. Such information is vital to developing more individualized ways of preventing, diagnosing and treating common diseases.</p>
