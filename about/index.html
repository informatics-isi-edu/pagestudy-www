  <h3>Central Mission</h3>
  <p>
    The mission of the Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS) Program is to develop sensor-based research tools to measure environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma in the pediatric population
  </p>
  
  <h3>Three Arms of the PRISMS program</h3>

  <p>
    The following three arms of the PRISMS Program will be closely aligned to ensure functionality of the overall program.</p>
    <ul class="three-arms">
      <li><strong>Sensor Development Projects for Asthma</strong> - Researchers will develop wearable and non-wearable sensors that can monitor pediatric environmental exposures, physiological signals, activity, and/or behavior in a natural environment. They will pursue new insights into environmental determinants of asthma. These new, existing, or redesigned sensors will plug and play—physically or wirelessly—with the PRISMS informatics platforms.
    </li>
      <li><strong>Informatics Platform Technologies for Asthma</strong> - Researchers will develop informatics platforms that will enable data acquisition from environmental, physiological, and behavior sensors. These platforms will integrate, process, and visualize data, and will provide secure uploading of results to the PRISMS data and software coordination and integration center.</li>
      <li><strong>Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center</strong> - Researchers will develop a center to coordinate and integrate outputs from the Informatics Technology Platform Centers. The Center will coordinate and integrate data and ensure consistent annotation of data and tools generated within the PRISMS program. It will incorporate relevant non-PRISMS data into the PRISMS resource; support integration of relevant data and tools to allow for seamless exploration of the PRISMS program’s output by a broad range of biomedical researchers; support linkages to outside knowledge bases, data portals, and resources; support training in integrated sensor monitoring data science skills; build innovative access and query tools to disparate databases hosting multiple data types; and disseminate the resulting tools and resources to the broad range of biomedical researchers.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Our overarching goal is to develop a non-invasive health monitoring system for pediatric asthma research. Requirements for such a system include:
</p>
<ul class="reqs">
  <li>For sensors:
    <ul>
      <li>Wearable or stationary sensors that can monitor pediatric environmental exposures, physiological signals, activity, and /or behavior to gain insights into environmental determinants of asthma.</li>
      <li>Must be plug and play physically or wirelessly with the informatics platforms.</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For informatics platforms:
    <ul>
      <li>Technology platforms for the acquisition of data from the environmental, physiological, and behavioral sensors.</li>
      <li>Must have the capability for secure data transmission, processing, integration, and upload to the <a href="/projects/dscic/">Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (DSCIC)</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For the coordinating center:
    <ul>
      <li>Coordinates and integrates data from the informatics platforms.</li>
      <li>Ensures consistent annotation of data and tools generated.</li>
      <li>Builds innovative access and query tools to disparate databases</li>
      <li>Incorporates relevant non-PRISMS data into the PRISMS system</li>
      <li>Supports integration of relevant data and tools for seamless exploration of the PRISMS program output by a broad range of biomedical researchers, linkage to outside knowledge bases, data portals, and resources, and training in integrated sensor monitoring data science skills</li>
      <li>Disseminates resulting tools and resources to a broad range of biomedical researchers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
