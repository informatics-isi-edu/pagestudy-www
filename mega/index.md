title: Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA)
---

PAGE II genotyped 50,000 samples using MEGA, an Illumina high density custom exomechip array, to continue emphasis on characterizing population-level disease risks in non-European-descent individuals. Cohorts in PAGE II are:  CALiCo (Causal Variants Across the Life Course, a consortium of ARIC, CARDIA, HCHS/SOL, Strong Heart Studies), ISMMS (Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank), MEC (Multiethnic Cohort), and WHI (Womenâ€™s Health Initiative).  PAGE is investigating anthropometric, cardiovascular, hypertension, kidney, inflammatory, lipid, T2D, and other traits.

You can also find 637 SNP annotations and 575 Indel annotations for the MEGA loci from [WGSA](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/wgsa), as well as the PAGEII allele frequencies for each loci and population in PAGE. The package includes [tabix](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) formatted files for faster selection. Note that the compressed annotations file is large (2.1GB). The `PAGEII_WGSA_MEGA_QC_Filtering.tar.gz` file describes sites that were removed before annotation, and quality control workflow applied.
