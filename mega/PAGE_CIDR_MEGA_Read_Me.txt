The file PAGE_CIDR_MEGA_cluster_definitions.egt is the cluster file for the Infinium Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA), as determined by CIDR based on samples from the PAGE Study. Note that this array is the consortium version of the chip, which differs somewhat from the commercial versions with similar names.

The file PAGE_CIDR_MEGA_prep_overview.pdf, although produced by CIDR for PAGE, includes a description from CIDR regarding their technical approach to calling genotypes on the MEGA array.

If there are questions please contact Eimear Kenny, eimear.kenny@mssm.edu, or Steve Buyske, buyske@stat.rutgers.edu, both investigators with the PAGE Coordinating Center.
