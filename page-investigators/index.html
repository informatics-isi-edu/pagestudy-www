			<p>  NHGRI is developing a research program to <strong>identify and characterize genetic variants causally associated with complex human diseases in genome-wide association (GWA) and other genetic studies</strong>. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University has convened a strong team of statistical geneticists, molecular geneticists, genetic epidemiologists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). </p>

      	<p>  Specifically, the CC serves as a <strong>centralized genetic epidemiologic resource</strong> to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on replication and characterization of causal variants by: (1) <strong>utilizing innovative computer and information science methodologies</strong> to retrieve and synthesize in a comprehensible form study results and descriptive data obtained from the analysis of association, phenotypic, covariate/exposure and population ancestry data, including the impact of particular interventions on a given genotype-phenotype association and the risk of a specific trait associated with a given variant; (2) serving as a <strong>data clearinghouse</strong> for disseminating results and descriptive data on the epidemiologic architecture of putative disease-associated genetic variants, including detailed and standardized characterizations of the participating population studies, in <strong>user-friendly and readily interpretable formats</strong> that will maximize the utilization of data population impact and potential gene function by the scientific community; (3) utilizing <strong>state-of-the-art computer and information science support</strong> to develop cyberplatforms that will enable, stimulate and facilitate collaborations with outside investigators for future functional and translational research; and (4) serving as a <strong>centralized [...]</strong> to facilitate, support and manage as needed program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office as needed for successful coordination of the program.</p>

        <p>Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies for GWAs and approaches to project management. <strong>The ultimate goal of our CC will be to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, thereby accelerating our understanding of the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases.</strong>
